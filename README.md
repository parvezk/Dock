## Dock Container API

Dock is a software container tool designed and developed by the company Dock Inc. It is designed to make it easier to deploying and running applications by using Containers. 

This containers tool allow a developer to package up an application or software he is building with all of the external parts it needs (such as vendor libraries and other dependencies) and ship it all out as one package. Isolated containers are then portable on any machine or operating system running Dock software.  gt
