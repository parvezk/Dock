## Container API

Docker is a software container tool designed and developed by the Docker Software. It is designed to make it easier to deploying and running applications by using Containers. 

Containers allow a developer to package up an application or software he is building with all of the external parts it needs (such as vendor libraries and other dependencies) and ship it all out as one package. Isolated containers are then portable on any machine or operating system running Docker.
